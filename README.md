Course: Data Mining by Prof. Shayok Chakraborthy, ASU, Fall 2016

The main aim of this assignment is to study the applications of basic Classifiers namely KNN and Neural Networks, and also to familiarize oneself with Matlab. 

Task 1:
We were given The Human Activity Dataset, with features of dimension 561, the training set contains 7352 samples and the test set contains 2947 samples. The task was to recognise various Human activities, such as, Walking, Walking_Upstairs, etc. (basically, 6 classes)
We were to implement KNN with K = 7, with simple Euclidean Distance similarity metric and report the accuracy.

Task 2:
We were given VidTIMIT dataset, which consists of video and audio recordings of 43 subjects reciting short sentences. We were instructed to use only the Video Modality. The videos were sliced into images and the discrete cosine transform function was used to extract feature vectors of dimension 100 from each image. The training set contains 3,500 samples and the test set contains 1,000 samples. The aim is to recognize the subject from the given image.

We were to implement KNN with K = 7, with simple Euclidean Distance similarity metric and report the accuracy and also train a Feedforward Neural Network, with 1 hidden layer containing 25 neurons. In Matlab, we used the function "Feedforwardnet"
